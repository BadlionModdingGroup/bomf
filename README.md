# Badlion Open Mapping Files

### These mappings are designed for use modding the Badlion client.

Simply run the `gradlew bomf` task. Then run `launchEnigma.bat` to launch Enigma. Only dependencies are the latest BLC for 1.8.9 and a Java installation in your PATH. (Linux/Mac not tested)

Here are some conventions for these mappings:
* Mods that add HUD elements or overlays should be mapped as `ModNameDisplayMod`, and other mods should be mapped as `ModNameMod`.
* Follow the conventions used in Yarn, e.g. international spelling.
